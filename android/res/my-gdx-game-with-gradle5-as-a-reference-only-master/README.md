# my-gdx-game-with-gradle5-as-a-reference-only

This repository is meant as a reference point only for the 1.9.9 setup version of LibGDX with Gradle 5.1.1 added.  You may eventually have trouble with Instant Run from Android with this setup.  If you use IntelliJ, you can disable Instant Run in Settings.  Doing so should only affect this particular project.  Something similar probably applies to Android Studio.

Follow the links below if you need setup guidance.  The basics remain the same as for the standard setup, like needing to Edit the Run Configuration so the DesktopLauncher can find assets in the ../android/assets folder.
